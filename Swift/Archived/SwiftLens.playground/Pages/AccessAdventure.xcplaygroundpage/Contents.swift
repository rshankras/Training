## Episode 4: Access Adventures

Welcome to the final episode of Karan and Naina's SwiftLens journey!  They're exploring Access Control in Swift. This will help them organize their code and protect sensitive information. Let's join them!

/*:
## Challenges

### Challenge 1: The Secure Artifact Vault

Create a `SecureArtifactVault` class that stores valuable artifacts. The vault should have a private array of artifacts and a public method to add artifacts. Create a method that displays the number of artifacts but not their details.

### Challenge 2: The Museum Exhibit

Create a `MuseumExhibit` class that has both public and private properties. Include a method that can only be accessed by other types in the same file. Then, create a `MuseumGuide` class that interacts with the `MuseumExhibit` in a way that demonstrates your understanding of different access levels.

Write your solutions below:

 Great attempt! Now let's look at the solutions.
 
 ## Solutions
 
 ### Challenge 1: The Secure Artifact Vault
 */

public class SecureArtifactVault {
    private var artifacts: [String] = []
    
    public func addArtifact(_ artifact: String) {
        artifacts.append(artifact)
        print("\(artifact) has been securely added to the vault.")
    }
    
    public func displayArtifactCount() {
        print("The vault contains \(artifacts.count) artifact(s).")
    }
}

print("\nKaran: Let's test our Secure Artifact Vault!")
let vault = SecureArtifactVault()
vault.addArtifact("Kohinoor Diamond")
vault.addArtifact("Peacock Throne")
vault.displayArtifactCount()

/*:
 Explanation:
 1. The `artifacts` array is private, so it can't be accessed outside the class.
 2. `addArtifact(_:)` is public, allowing artifacts to be added from anywhere.
 3. `displayArtifactCount()` is public but only shows the count, not the actual artifacts.
 
 ### Challenge 2: The Museum Exhibit
