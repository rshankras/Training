/*:
Great job! You've helped Karan and Naina manage memory in SwiftLens. Here's what we learned:

1. Using `weak` references to avoid retain cycles
2. Using `unowned` references when we're sure the reference will always have a value
3. Using closure capture lists with `[weak self]` to avoid retain cycles in closures

Now, it's challenge time!
*/

/*:
## Challenge 1: The Forgetful Tour Guide

Create a `TourGuide` class that has an optional `currentLocation` property of type `CulturalArtifact`. Make sure the `TourGuide` doesn't keep the `CulturalArtifact` in memory after it's no longer needed.

Hint: Think about which type of reference you should use for `currentLocation`.
*/

// Write your solution here


/*:
## Challenge 2: The Artifact Collector

Create an `ArtifactCollector` class that has an array of `CulturalArtifact` objects. Add methods to add and remove artifacts from the collection. Make sure that when an artifact is removed from the collection, it's properly deallocated.

Hint: Think about how you can test if the artifact is deallocated after removal.
