## Episode 2: Type Tango

Karan and Naina are learning about Type Casting in Swift. This will help them manage different types of cultural artifacts in their app. Let's join them!

print("\nNaina: Great! Now let's try some challenges to practice Type Casting.")

/*:
## Challenges

### Challenge 1: The Artifact Identifier

Create a function called `identifyArtifact` that takes a `CulturalItem` as input and returns a string describing the item. If it's a Monument, include its height. If it's a Painting, include the artist's name.

### Challenge 2: The Museum Catalogue

Create a `Museum` class that has an array of `CulturalItem` objects. Add methods to add items to the museum and to generate a catalogue that lists all items, including their specific details (height for monuments, artist for paintings).
