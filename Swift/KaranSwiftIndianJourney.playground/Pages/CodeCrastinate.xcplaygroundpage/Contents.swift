# The Lazy Coder's App ðŸ˜´ðŸ’»

Welcome to Bangalore, India's Silicon Valley! Karan has arrived in this tech hub, ready to dive into some serious coding. But wait... is that a new Netflix series calling his name?

## Karan's Procrastination Station

In a moment of self-aware humor, Karan decides to channel his procrastination into productivity by creating an app that simulates a lazy programmer's day. Let's help Karan build his "Lazy Coder" app using some advanced Swift concepts!

/*:
## Challenge Time! ðŸ§ ðŸ’ª

Help Karan enhance his Lazy Coder app with these challenges:

1. Implement a function called `debugCode()` that uses optionals to represent potential bugs.
   The function should print different messages based on whether a bug is found and its severity.
   Hint: Use an optional enum for bug severity and optional binding to handle the cases.
 
2. Implement a `refactorCode()` function that has a chance to either improve or break the existing code.
   Use enums, control flow, and string interpolation to create humorous messages about the refactoring results.
   Hint: Use a random number generator to determine the outcome and switch statements to handle different scenarios.

Excellent work! You've helped Karan create a humorous yet surprisingly insightful procrastination simulation app. Remember, sometimes the best way to overcome procrastination is to lean into it creatively!

In our next chapter, we'll follow Karan to the glittering world of Bollywood in Mumbai, where we'll add some drama to our Swift skills!
